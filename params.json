In this course you will learn all of the basic skills needed to do each of these steps with the statistical language **R**. *Part I* of the course introduces you to both basic data structures and **RStudio** (a program that makes using **R** easier). *Part II* introduces basic data analysis and visualizations techniques. *Part III* covers slightly more advanced statistical tools, primarily linear regression. Finally, in *Part IV* we will apply all of these skills in a pair research project. \r\n\r\nAs part of achieving this straightforward objective, the course is intended to also do the following:\r\n\r\nThe course is intended to be *useful*. I hope that the course will be one of the more useful courses you take in university. It is intended to be useful for students who want to go on to do graduate-level *academic research*. It is also intended to be useful for students who want to go directly into the *non-academic public or private sectors* and be able to effectively analyse and present data. I hope it is also useful for you as a *citizen* in that you will be better able to critically read the data that informs many of our daily decisions.\r\n\r\nThis course will introduce you to a vibrant and growing community of open source data analysts that is pushing the state of the art in data analysis and presentation. (Another benefit to you as students is that open source software is free.)\r\n\r\nThis course emphasises the collection and analysis of social science data (particularly political science and economic data at the country-level). However, almost all of the skills you learn in this course can be applied to data in most other areas of study. **R** is widely used not only in the social sciences but also in medicine, biology, physics, and business.\r\n\r\n**Prerequisites:** If you have taken high school algebra, can use Microsoft Excel, and have an interest in experimenting and learning new things then you are qualified to take this course.\r\n\r\n**Course Materials:** The course [syllabus](https://github.com/christophergandrud/Introduction_to_Statistics_and_Data_Analysis_Yonsei/blob/master/README.md), lecture slides, [activities](https://github.com/christophergandrud/Introduction_to_Statistics_and_Data_Analysis_Yonsei/tree/master/Activities), the course [wiki](https://github.com/christophergandrud/Introduction_to_Statistics_and_Data_Analysis_Yonsei/wiki) and some data sets can be found on the course's main **github** site:\r\n\r\n> [https://github.com/christophergandrud/Introduction_to_Statistics_and_Data_Analysis_Yonsei](https://github.com/christophergandrud/Introduction_to_Statistics_and_Data_Analysis_Yonsei). \r\n\r\nYou are reading the course syllabus now. It has the file name `README.md` on **github**.\r\n\r\n**Software:** We use four software programs in this course:\r\n\r\n- Microsoft Excel\r\n- Dropbox\r\n- R (version 2.15)\r\n- RStudio (version 0.96)\r\n\r\nAll of the classroom computers have these programs installed. Please feel free to use your own computer. You can install both **R** and **RStudio** for free (they are open source!) on Windows, Mac, or Linux computers. Just take two steps:\r\n\r\n1. Install **R**: [http://www.r-project.org/](http://www.r-project.org/)\r\n\r\n2. Install **RStudio**: [http://rstudio.org/](http://rstudio.org/)\r\n\r\nThe course wiki has slightly more detailed [installation instructions](https://github.com/christophergandrud/Introduction_to_Statistics_and_Data_Analysis_Yonsei/wiki/Installing-R-and-RStudio).\r\n\r\n*I recommend using your own laptop computer.*\r\n\r\n**Dropbox** is an easy to use cloud storage system. You will be able to use it to access all of your files for the course on almost any computer. You can also submit your assignments to me through **Dropbox**. You can download **Dropbox** from [https://www.dropbox.com/](https://www.dropbox.com/). You will also need to sign up for a (free) account.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft Excel is not free, but you probably already have it. If you don't, you can use any other spreadsheet program like Hancell, Numbers, or Open Office. Open Office is open source and can be downloaded for free from [http://www.openoffice.org/](http://www.openoffice.org/).\r\n\r\n**Readings:** This is an applied course, so I want you to *do* more than you *consume* (read, listen to lectures). However, completing the course readings before each class is an important part of (a) being prepared to do the work in class, (b) obtaining a solid foundation in the methods and theory behind what we do in class, and (c) pointing you to useful reference material.\r\n\r\nThe main textbook for this class is *OpenIntro Statistics (first edition)*. You can find the PDF at: \r\n\r\n>[http://www.openintro.org/stat/downloads.php](http://www.openintro.org/stat/downloads.php). \r\n\r\n*OpenIntro Statistics* is an open source introductory statistics textbook written mostly by David M. Diez, Christopher D. Barr, and Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel. \r\n\r\nMost of the other readings for the course will be academic articles or blog posts by academic bloggers. I hope these will introduce you to the very active social science blogging community who are advancing the state of the art in data management and analysis.\r\n\r\nI also assign a few chapters from (and recommend for **R** reference):\r\n\r\n> Crawley, Michael J. 2005. *Statistics: An Introduction Using R*.

Inaddition to articles and presentations, people have been using new formats such as **Twitter** and blogs to share their work and ideas. To help develop your skills using these formats you will post your work for some of the short assignments and pair research project on the class blog. You should post both the output of your work and the code you used to create it. The blog is at:\r\n\r\n> <http://yonsei-data-analysis.tumblr.com/>\r\n\r\nIt is password protected. I will give you the password in class. More details about how to post on the blog will be given in class. \r\n\r\nOther details about the assignments will also be given in class.\r\n\r\n## Part I: Introduction to Data Gathering and Management in R\r\n\r\n### Week 1: Course Introduction and R Introduction\r\nI cover the course objectives, give you some examples of the type of data analysis and visualizations you will learn how to do in the course, and start working with **RStudio**.\r\n\r\n*Extra:*\r\n\r\n> **Introduction & Chapter 1:** Matloff, Norman. 2011. *The Art of R Programming: A Tour of Statistical Design Software*.

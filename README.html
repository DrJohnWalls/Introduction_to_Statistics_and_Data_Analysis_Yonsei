<h1>Introduction to Applied Statistics and Data Analysis for Social Science</h1>

<h2>Yonsei University, Wonju</h2>

<h3>Fall 2012 (<em>Early and Incomplete Draft Version</em>)</h3>

<p></center></p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Dr. Christopher Gandrud </p>

<ul>
<li>Email: <a href = "mailto:gandrud@yonsei.ac.kr"><a href="mailto:gandrud@yonsei.ac.kr">gandrud@yonsei.ac.kr</a></a></li>
<li>Website: <a href="http://christophergandrud.blogspot.com/">http://christophergandrud.blogspot.com/</a></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Office Hours:</strong> TBD (정208)</p>

<ul>
<li>You can also send me an email or come to my office whenever you need to.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Time:</strong> TBD</p>

<p><strong>Objectives:</strong> This course&#39;s main objective is to: <em>learn how to take raw data, explore it, and present the results to an academic audience in a useful way</em>. In this course you will learn all of the basic skills needed to do each of these steps with the statistical language <strong>R</strong>. <em>Part I</em> of the course introduces you to both basic data structures and <strong>RStudio</strong> (a program that makes using <strong>R</strong> easier). <em>Part II</em> introduces basic data analysis and visualizations techniques. <em>Part III</em> covers slightly more advanced statistical tools, primarily linear regression. Finally, in <em>Part IV</em> we will apply all of these skills in a research project. </p>

<p>As part of achieving this straightforward objective, the course is intended to also do the following:</p>

<p>The course is intended to be <em>useful</em>. I hope that the course will be one of the more useful courses you take in university. It is intended to be useful for students who want to go on to do graduate-level research. It is also intended to be useful for students who want to go directly into the non-academic public or private sectors and be able to effectively analyse and present data. I hope it is also useful for you as a citizen in that you will be better able to critically read the data that informs many of our daily decisions.</p>

<p>This course will introduce you to a vibrant and growing community of open source data analysts that are pushing the state of the art. (Another benefit to you as students is that open source software is free.)</p>

<p>This course emphasises the collection and analysis of social science data (particularly political science and economic data at the country-level). However, almost all of the skills you learn in this course can be applied to data in most other areas of study. <strong>R</strong> is widely used not only in the social sciences but also in medicine, biology, physics, and business.</p>

<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> If you have taken high school algebra, can use Microsoft Excel, and have an interest in experimenting and learning new things then you are qualified to take this course.</p>

<p><strong>Course Materials:</strong> The course syllabus, lecture slides, activities, and some data sets can be found on the course <strong>github</strong> site:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/christophergandrud/Introduction_to_Statistics_and_Data_Analysis_Yonsei">https://github.com/christophergandrud/Introduction_to_Statistics_and_Data_Analysis_Yonsei</a>. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are reading the course syllabus now. It has the file name <code>README.md</code> on <strong>github</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Software:</strong> We use four software programs in this course:</p>

<ul>
<li>Microsoft Excel</li>
<li>Dropbox</li>
<li>R (version 2.15)</li>
<li>RStudio (version 0.96)</li>
</ul>

<p>All of the classroom computers have these programs installed. Please feel free to use your own computer. You can install both <strong>R</strong> and <strong>RStudio</strong> for free (they are open source!) on Windows, Mac, or Linux computers. Just take two steps:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Install <strong>R</strong>: <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">http://www.r-project.org/</a></p></li>
<li><p>Install <strong>RStudio</strong>: <a href="http://rstudio.org/">http://rstudio.org/</a></p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Dropbox</strong> is an easy to use cloud storage system. You will be able to store and access from almost any computer all of your files for this course in <strong>Dropbox</strong>. You can also submit many of your assignments to me through it. You can download <strong>Dropbox</strong> from <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">https://www.dropbox.com/</a>. You will also need to sign up for a (free) account.</p>

<p>Microsoft Excel is not free, but you probably already have it. If you don&#39;t, you can use any other spreadsheet program like Hancell, Numbers, or Open Office. Open Office is open source and can be downloaded for free from <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">http://www.openoffice.org/</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Readings:</strong> This is an applied course, so I want you to <em>do</em> more than you <em>consume</em> (read, listen to lectures). However, completing the course readings before each class is an important part of (a) being prepared to do the work in class, (b) obtaining a solid foundation in the methods and theory behind what we do in class, and &copy; pointing you to useful reference material.</p>

<p>The main textbook for this class is <em>OpenIntro Statistics (first edition)</em>. You can find the PDF at: </p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.openintro.org/stat/downloads.php">http://www.openintro.org/stat/downloads.php</a>. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>OpenIntro Statistics</em> is an open source introductory statistics textbook written mostly by David M. Diez, Christopher D. Barr, and Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel. </p>

<p>Most of the other readings for the course will be academic articles or blogposts by academic bloggers. I hope these will introduce you to the very active social science blogging community who are advancing the state of the art in data management and analysis.</p>

<p>I also assign a few chapters from (and recommend for <strong>R</strong> reference):</p>

Have a data set with three variables of the following type:

- 1 numeric continuous variable,

- 1 dummy variable,

- 1 multinomial variable.

There should be more than 50 observations per variable & variable category.

Find the answers to the following questions:

### Numeric Continuous Variable

- What do you predict the population mean of this variable is? 

- Create two groups of this variable based on the dummy variable. Are the population means of these two groups likely to be different?

### Dummy Variable

- What are the likely population proportions of the two values of this variable?

### Multinomial Variable

- What are the likely population proportions of the values of this variable?

## Always remember: we don't really care about point estimates we care about ranges of likely values.
